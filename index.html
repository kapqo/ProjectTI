                        Australia, the smallest continent and one of the largest countries on Earth, lying between the Pacific and Indian oceans in the Southern Hemisphere. Australia’s capital is Canberra, located in the southeast between the larger and more important economic and cultural centres of Sydney and Melbourne.                </p>
                <p>
                        The Australian mainland extends from west to east for nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) and from Cape York Peninsula in the northeast to Wilsons Promontory in the southeast for nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 km). To the south, Australian jurisdiction extends a further 310 miles (500 km) to the southern extremity of the island of Tasmania, and in the north it extends to the southern shores of Papua New Guinea. Australia is separated from Indonesia to the northwest by the Timor and Arafura seas, from Papua New Guinea to the northeast by the Coral Sea and the Torres Strait, from the Coral Sea Islands Territory by the Great Barrier Reef, from New Zealand to the southeast by the Tasman Sea, and from Antarctica in the far south by the Indian Ocean.                </p>
                <p>
                        Australia has been called “the Oldest Continent,” “the Last of Lands,” and “the Last Frontier.” Those descriptions typify the world’s fascination with Australia, but they are somewhat unsatisfactory. In simple physical terms, the age of much of the continent is certainly impressive—most of the rocks providing the foundation of Australian landforms were formed during Precambrian and Paleozoic time (some 4.6 billion to 252 million years ago)—but the ages of the cores of all the continents are approximately the same. On the other hand, whereas the landscape history of extensive areas in Europe and North America has been profoundly influenced by events and processes that occurred since late in the last Ice Age—roughly the past 25,000 years—in Australia scientists use a more extensive timescale that takes into account the great antiquity of the continent’s landscape.                </p>
                <p>
                        Australia is the last of lands only in the sense that it was the last continent, apart from Antarctica, to be explored by Europeans. At least 60,000 years before European explorers sailed into the South Pacific, the first Aboriginal explorers had arrived from Asia, and by 20,000 years ago they had spread throughout the mainland and its chief island outlier, Tasmania. When Captain Arthur Phillip of the British Royal Navy landed with the First Fleet at Botany Bay in 1788, there may have been between 250,000 and 500,000 Aboriginals, though some estimates are much higher. Largely nomadic hunters and gatherers, the Aboriginals had already transformed the primeval landscape, principally by the use of fire, and, contrary to common European perceptions, they had established robust, semipermanent settlements in well-favoured localities.                </p>

                              Australia is one of the largest countries on Earth, and the only country that covers an entire continent. Although it is rich in natural resources and has a lot of fertile land, more than one-third of Australia is desert.                  </p>
                  <p>
                              Most Australian cities and farms are located in the southwest and southeast, where the climate is more comfortable. The famous outback (remote rural areas) contains the country’s largest deserts, where there are scorching temperatures, little water and almost no vegetation. In the northeast, there are dense rainforests where lush vegetation grows.                  </p>
                  <p>
                              Running around the eastern and southeastern edge of Australia is the Great Dividing Range. This 3,700-kilometre stretch of mountain sends water down into Australia’s most important rivers and the Great Artesian Basin, the largest groundwater source in the world.                  </p>
                  <p>
                              Australia’s ecosystem is an unusual one. Because of its remote location, many animal species that occur here are found nowhere else on Earth, such as the platypus, kangaroo, echidna and koala. Australia has 516 national parks to protect its unique plants and animals.                  </p>
                   <p>
                              There are several types of rainforests in Australia. Tropical rainforests, mainly found in the northeast, are the richest in plant and animal species. Subtropical rainforests are found near the mid-eastern coast, and broadleaf rainforests grow in the southeast and on the island of Tasmania.                   </p>

                                    To understand what is the Australian Outback you need to know that Australia is one of the most urbanized countries in the world. Our population is concentrated in the cities along the southern and eastern coast, or not far from it. The only other "populated" region is the area around the city of Perth on the southern west coast.                      </p>
                        <p>
                                    The Australian Outback is just about everywhere else... 6.5 million square kilometres of it (or 2.5 million square miles), inhabited by less than 60,000 people... It's impossible to answer the question "Where is the Australian Outback?", because it is not a precise location. The term Outback is used to describe the emptiness, remoteness, and the huge distances of inland Australia, and the fact that most people still don't know much about it... You will find that not all Australians talk about "the Outback". The further away from the cities we live, the less we are inclined to call it the Outback.                      </p>
                        <p>
                                    Australians talk about "the bush" when they refer to wilderness areas outside the cities. As they move further and further away from what they know as the bush, they eventually cross some invisible line and find themselves in the Outback, the part of Australia they don't know, the harsh and unforgiving interior... (well, is it?) Where exactly that line is located, and exactly what is the Australian Outback, depends on the individual person... Those of us who live in the Australian Outback respect this country, and we love it. We love the fact that nature reigns supreme here, we love the unspoiled beauty, the space and the freedom... and we intimately know the places that many people call "the Outback". It's not harsh or forbidding to us...                      </p>
                        <p>
                                    For us it's a familiar place, it's home, and so "the Outback" becomes "the bush" again... Ok, back to you:                       </p>
                         <p>
                                    I assume you are unfamiliar with Australia, or at least unfamiliar with the Australian interior, so it's all Outback to you...                         </p>

                                          Sydney, city, capital of the state of New South Wales, Australia. Located on Australia’s southeastern coast, Sydney is the country’s largest city and, with its magnificent harbour and strategic position, is one of the most important ports in the South Pacific. In the early 19th century, when it was still a small convict settlement and the first settlers had barely penetrated the interior, it had already established trade with the Pacific Islands, India, China, South Africa, and the Americas.                              </p>
                              <p>
                                          The first sight of Sydney, whether from the sea or the air, is always spectacular. Built on low hills surrounding a huge harbour with innumerable bays and inlets, the city is dominated by the bulk of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, one of the longest steel-arch bridges in the world, and the Opera House, with its glittering white shell-shaped roofs that seem to echo the sails of the many yachts in the adjacent harbour. The intricate confusion of water and buildings makes a striking impression either by day or by night.                              </p>
                              <p>
                                          Because of its history as a great port and its status as the site of the country’s main international air terminal, Sydney is perhaps the only city in Australia with a genuinely international atmosphere. Yet it remains a very Australian city, with a nice compromise between its British heritage and the South Seas attractions of its climate and environment. Area City of Sydney, 10.3 square miles (26.7 square km); Greater Sydney Statistical Area, 4,790 square miles (12,406 square km). Pop. (2001) City of Sydney, 128,544; Greater Sydney Statistical Area, 3,997,321; (2011) City of Sydney, 169,501; Greater Sydney Statistical Area, 4,429,034.                              </p>
                              <p>
                                          Sydney is situated on latitude 34° S and has an average mean temperature ranging from 72 °F (22 °C) in January to 55 °F (13 °C) in July. Its warm, sunny, but temperate climate has encouraged its citizens to develop a pleasure-loving and easygoing attitude to life and to make full use of the opportunities for sailing, swimming, and surfing at their doors. The average annual precipitation (all falling as rain) is 47 inches (1,200 mm), spread relatively evenly throughout the year. The greatest amount falls in late autumn and the least in early spring, with short tropical deluges in summer (December–February). Sydney is unbearably hot for only a few days each year, when a westerly wind brings hot dry air from the desert. Extreme summer heat is tempered from time to time by the arrival of a cold front from the Tasman Sea, heralded by a stiff wind from the south known locally as the “Southerly Buster.” In winter (June–August), however, the westerly wind is cool.                              </p>
                               <p>
                                          Sydney was founded by the British, and the largest proportion of its citizens is still of British stock, if that term is extended to include persons of Irish descent. In the period after World War II, however, Australia took in large numbers of immigrants from other European countries and from Asia, including people of Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, and Vietnamese origins. New Zealand also provides a large number of immigrants. Many of these newcomers settled in Sydney. Some of the inner suburbs have a distinctly Greek or Italian character, and almost every suburb has its variety of ethnic restaurants. There is a Chinatown, and one suburb, Redfern, has a small community of Aboriginals living under somewhat depressed conditions.                               </p>
